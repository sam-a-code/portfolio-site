# ðŸŒ¸ Sam Avery's personal website

Hi there! I'm Sam. I built this website to share my career history, as well as to display my technical and ðŸŽ¨ artistic projects. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ðŸª´ Installing my site
#### `npm install`

## ðŸŒ¿ Using my site

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

When you make changes the page will reload automatically. You may also see lint errors in the console.
