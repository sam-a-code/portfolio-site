                    <h2>Who I am</h2>
                    <p>I'm Sam – lover of farmers markets, creative pursuits, bad puns, and the em dash. I believe it's important to leave our campsites cleaner than we found them. The most popular spreadsheet I've ever created is one for restaurants – new ones I want to try, ones I recommend for out of town guests, dishes you can't miss, etc. You can filter by brunch and patio availability, obviously.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my journey I've collected a pretty wide array of experiences. From program managing a social impact business conference, to wearing a ton of hats at a startup focused on creative fulfillment, to graduating from a software engineering bootcamp and building this website (the one you're on right now!), my experience has always been focused on learning, creativity, and social impact. </p>
                    <p>I'm inspired by businesses who are focused on making the world a better place and I'm driven by work that helps people accomplish their creative goals. I also draw a lot – check out some of my designs on the art tab. I'm relaunching my design website soon, so keep an eye out!</p>

                    <h2>What I do</h2>
                    <p>Currently, I'm working in Operations at a fintech company and loving it.</p>
                    <p>I started out working in events at a production facility, hosting music nights, film premieres, workshops, album launches, and more. After a few years, I was promoted to the Operations team, supporting the global network of production sites. After about five years at that company, I decided it was time for a change. I quit my job (leaving a team I loved dearly), put almost all of my possessions in storage, and drove across the country.</p>
                    <p>I joined a startup that offered e-learning experiences for creatives. While there, I realized that I could be significantly more self-sufficient if I improved my technical skills. I learned how to update our codebase with new class launch content – even implementing some bug fixes! It was empowering to be able to make changes myself, and that gave me the push I needed to sign up for a coding bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>The bootcamp was one of the most challenging things I've undertaken in a long time, but I'm so glad I did it. It felt good to challenge myself and to bet on myself – that this leap of faith would pay off. We learned React.js (my favorite), Ruby on Rails, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and more.</p>

                    <h2>Why I do it</h2>
                    <p>I think the world is so much more vibrant with art and creativity and connection – and I try to incorporate each of them into my life every day.</p>
