                    <h1>Who I am</h1>
                    <h3>I'm passionate about learning and creativity, and programs that help people do both. I love the farmers market, houseplants, and trying new recipes. I draw a lot, usually pretty abstract designs that I then print on apparel – there are few better feelings than wearing something you created.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I believe it's important to leave our campsites cleaner than we found them (I could not be less outdoorsy, but I do love the sentiment). I love being the person that my friends text for restuarant recommendations, and I make sure to keep my restaurant spreadsheet updated.</h3>
                    <h3>The teams on which I've worked have been dedicated to creating, distributing, and promoting creative communities. As I've progressed in my career, I've taken on more and more ownership of managing programs. After a few years getting closer to the technical side of program management, I decided to take the leap in to Software Engineering.</h3>

                    <h1>What I do</h1>
                    <h3>I started out working in events at a production facility, and eventually transitioned to working on the Operations team for our global facility network. Much of my work focused on tools and process – and making sure the work I did could apply to teams and users at all of our global locations. After about five years at that job, I decided it was time for a change. I quit my job (leaving a team I loved dearly), put almost all of my possessions in storage, and drove across the country.</h3>
                    <h3>I started working at a startup that focused on making creative fulfillment attainable for everyone. While there, more and more of my work involved me increasing my technical skills. I even started using VS Code to update our codebase with new class launches and bug fixes. It was empowering to be able to make changes myself, and that made me realize that I wanted to sign up for a software bootcamp.</h3>
                    <h3>The bootcamp was one of the most challenging things I've undertaken in a long time – but I'm so glad I did it. It felt good to challenge myself, to learn about a whole new world, and to bet on myself – that this program would pay off in my career. We learned React.js (my favorite), Ruby on Rails, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and more. I supplemented my learning with CodeCademy modules, wanting to learn the information from several differnt sources. I built the website you're on now – and that feels great. Click over to my coding portfolio to see some of the other projects I've created!</h3>

                    <h1>Why I do it</h1>
                    <h3>Right before I made the leap to the coding bootcamp, I realized I had cultivated a pretty unique array of skills. Between my program management, my relationship building, my ability to translate content between audiences (i.e. technical concepts to a non-technical audience), my strenghth in writing thorough documentation, I knew that if I took on more technical learning, I could provide even more value to the next team I joined.</h3>
                    <h3>I genuinely enjoy improving user experiences (whether for internal or external users), I love learning the ins and outs of new tools, and I find satisfaction in making processes more efficient. Also, I think the world is so much more vibrant with art and creativity and connection – I'd love to help contribute to that in any number of ways.
                    </h3>

                <ul className="bio-list-header">I figure you're on this website to get to know me, so here are a few things about me outside of work:
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">I love finding new restaurants to try AND I love spreadsheets. Every time I move to a new city one of the first things I do is create my restaurant spreadsheet. And yes, I always make sure you can filter by brunch availability. I'm the friend people text for restaurant recommendations when they're trying to impress someone.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">Hardcore lover of plants. When I was living in LA I had a toooon of succulents – I loved propagating them and seeing how resilient they all are. Now that I'm in Chicago without a balcony, I've pivoted to houseplants and learning all about those. Did you know the calathea opens and closes with the sun each day? </li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">In the same theme as the above, I love to visit botanical gardens and conservatories whenever I can. There are few better feelings than being in a room full of plants and greenery. The fern room at the Garfield Park Conservatory is particularly notable.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">One of my favorite questions to ask people is what they've been reading lately. It's such a good way to learn more about a friend you've known forever or someone to just met. Plus, I always end up with great new recommendations.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">I'm an artist – I design patterns and get them printed on clothing. I had an e-commerce clothing company where I sold apparel and accessories printed with my artwork. I shuttered the company because I wanted to pivot to more sustainable creation and distribution. My next art endeavor is learning how to screenprint, with the goal of putting my patterns on unique thrifted pieces.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">I love a good farmers market (actually, I even love a bad one). That's actually how I found my current apartment – I plugged my favorite market into a map and only looked at buildings that were walking distance from it. Easily one of the best ideas I've ever had, if I do say so myself.</li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>

                <ul className="bio-list-header">And now the professional "get to know me" list:
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">I love helping creatives pursue their dreams. YouTube Spaces were production facilities for the YouTube Creator community. Studio is a startup with the goal of making creative fulfillment attainable for everyone. The opportunity to work at organizations that help people create innovative projects, challenge themselves to grow, and connect with creative communities is something I feel very lucky to have experienced.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">Much of my work has been tools-focused, which was a key reason that I decided to complete a coding bootcamp. Over the years, I'd gotten closer and closer to the technical side of projects and I wanted to be able to really understand what goes in to the engineering of programs and projects. In December 2022, I graduated from the Flatiron Software Engineering Full Stack Bootcamp.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">One of the parts of being an engineer that I like the most is having an idea and being able to bring it to life (like this website that you're on right now!). It's empowering to tackle new projects, learn new skills, and to flex my design muslces.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li className="bio-list">I excel at building cross-functional relationships and communicating between different teams. I love the challenges of program management – balancing requests from multiple stakeholders, creating and improving processes, and ensuring all deliverables are fulfilled in a timely manner with a fantastic attitude.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>I think it's our responsibility to make the world a better place together. I'd love to join a team where I can do that through my work, <br></br>whether that's through continuing to support creative communities, joining a company focused on social impact, <br></br>or being involved in a team's volunteer initiatives.</h4>
