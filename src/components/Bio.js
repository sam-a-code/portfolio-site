                    <h2>Who I am</h2>
                    <p>I'm Sam – lover of farmers markets, creative pursuits, bad puns, and the em dash. I believe it's important to leave our campsites cleaner than we found them (despite not being very outdoorsy, I do love this sentiment). The most popular spreadsheet I've ever created is one for restaurants – new ones I want to try, ones I recommend for out of town guests, dishes you simply MUST order, etc. You can filter by brunch and patio availability, obviously.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my journey I've collected a pretty wide array of experiences. From program managing a social impact business conference, to wearing a ton of hats at a startup focused on creative fulfillment, to graduating from a software engineering bootcamp and building this website (the one you're on right now!), my experience has always been focused on learning, creativity, and social impact. </p>
                    <p>I'm inspired by businesses who are focused on making the world a better place and I'm driven by work that helps people accomplish their creative goals. I also draw a lot – check out some of my designs on the art tab.</p>

                    <h2>What I do</h2>
                    <p>Currently, what I'm doing is looking for a job! The roles in which I'm most interested are: Program Manager, Product Manager, or Software Developer.</p>
                    <p>I started out working in events at a production facility, hosting music nights, film premieres, workshops, album launches, and more. After a few years, I was promoted to the Operations team, supporting the global network of production sites. After about five years at that company, I decided it was time for a change. I quit my job (leaving a team I loved dearly), put almost all of my possessions in storage, and drove across the country.</p>
                    <p>I joined a startup that offered e-learning experiences for creatives. While there, I realized that I could be significantly more self-sufficient if I improved my technical skills. I learned how to update our codebase with new class launch content – even implementing some bug fixes! It was empowering to be able to make changes myself, and that gave me the push I needed to sign up for a coding bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>The bootcamp was one of the most challenging things I've undertaken in a long time, but I'm so glad I did it. It felt good to challenge myself and to bet on myself – that this leap of faith would pay off. We learned React.js (my favorite), Ruby on Rails, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and more.

                    <h2>Why I do it</h2>
                    <p>I think the world is so much more vibrant with art and creativity and connection – and I can't wait to see how I can incorporate those into my next role.</p>
                    <p>I excel at building cross-functional relationships and communicating between different teams. I love the challenges of program management – balancing requests from multiple stakeholders, creating and improving processes, and ensuring all deliverables are fulfilled on time and with a fantastic attitude. I love learning the ins and outs of new tools and I find satisfaction in making processes more efficient.</p>
                    <p>I'm eager to implement my new software engineering skills wherever I can. The ability to build new features, improve user journeys from a process and UX perspective, and to continue improving my technical expertise makes me really excited for whatever comes next.</p>
